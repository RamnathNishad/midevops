            The first big rule in sales is that if the person leaves empty-handed,
            they're likely not going to come back. That's why you have to be
            somewhat aggressive when you're working with a customer, but you have
            to make sure you don't overdo it and scare them away.</p>

            One way you can keep a conversation going is to avoid asking questions
            that have yes or no answers. For example, if you're selling a service
            plan, don't ever ask &quot;Are you interested in our 3 or 5 year
            service plan?&quot; Instead, ask &quot;Are you interested in the 3
            year service plan or the 5 year plan, which is a better value?&quot;
            At first glance, they appear to be asking the same thing, and while
            a customer can still opt out, it's harder for them to opt out of
            the second question because they have to say more than just
            &quot;no.&quot;
